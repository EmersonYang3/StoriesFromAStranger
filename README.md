# Notes From A Stranger

Every day, 8 billion people experience life in their own unique way. _Notes From A Stranger_ is an interactive platform that allows you to see the world through someone else's eyes.

## About

**Notes From A Stranger** is a place where you can read random notes and write your own. All notes are anonymous by default, but you have the option to sign them with a name of your choosing. For the time being, all notes have a 1 view expiration.
