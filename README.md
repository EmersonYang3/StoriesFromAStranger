# Stories From A Stranger

Every day, more than 8 billion people experience life in their own unqiue way. _Stories From A Stranger_ is an interactive platform that allows you to see the world through someone else's eyes by reading their story. Everyone has a story and we are here to listen.

## About

**Stories From A Stranger** is a place where you can read random notes and write your own. All notes are by default anonymous, but you have the option to sign them with a name of your choosing. For the time being, all notes have a default expiration of _one_ view until further notice.

## Inspiration

This project was heavily inspired by Hunter Prosper's series _Stories From A Stranger_. You can check out his work here:
